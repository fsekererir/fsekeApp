8.75

Explanation: The code is a mathematical equation that calculates the sum of an arithmetic series. The first term (a) is 1, the common difference (d) is 0.4, and the number of terms (n) is 20.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]

Substituting the given values into this formula: S = 20/2 * [2*1 + (20-1)*0.4] = 875/16 â‰ˆ 54.6875 or rounded to two decimal places, it's approximately 8.75
